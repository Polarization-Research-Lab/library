## Author Formatting Guide

Each submission contains a collection of crucial information that helps clarify and summarize an existing academic article -- providing all the information listed in [this submission template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11JIGp8j58-6gW4ZmUimDtb-gEWtAvv66/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=100469505346687216493&rtpof=true&sd=true).


<!-- Each summary should contain the following information: 

1. Article title
2. Article authors (in order)
3. Journal
4. Date published
5. Full citation (APA style)
6. Bibtex entry
7. Link to the article on the journal website
8. Link to the article on the author’s website (if available)
9. Tags
10. Summary (~300 words each). See below for more on the writing style. 
  - Introduction – what is the article about? What is the key question they are asking? Why are they asking this question? What questions are answered by this paper?
  - What analytical approach was used.  What were the design choices?  For all quantitative projects generate either a DAG (non-experimental designs) or a full table of all randomized conditions.
  - What are the main findings? How does this article add to our understanding of the topic? Make this punchy and clear. 
  - What are the implications of the research? Did this research introduce us to something new that needs to be studied further? Did it use new data or provide a new way of answering the question?
  - What questions identified by the authors were left unanswered? 
11. Pre-registration 
  - Was the study and its analysis pre registered (Yes/No/published before 2015)
12. Polarization Proxies
  - Did the authors have to rely on proxy variables (i.e., if the author was interested in affective polarization of partisans did they use a standard measure or did they have to use something else because of limits in currently available data)? 
13. Inference Metrics
  - Were standard p-value thresholds used (p<.05 or 95% Confidence Intervals that don’t overlap zero). 
  - Largest p-value presented as significant.
14. Causal Claims from Correlational Data
- Were correlational results interpreted with causal language? 
15. Open Data & Materials
  - Is the data available? 
  - are the replication scripts available?
  - Link to replication data and scripts (if available). 
16. Limitations/weaknesses 
We ask that you use [this template]() to complete your submission.

### Writing Style 

The goals of the summaries are clarity, accessibility, and transparency. While academics may read these summaries, our target audience for the writing style and language is an undergraduate or advanced high school student. We want to remove academic jargon as much as possible, and explain concepts and findings using words that you might find in a textbook or well-researched newspaper article. If academic terms are critical for the summary, be sure to explain them and provide examples of what they mean. For example, you might say that “political elites” can include current and former elected officials. 

### Citation Style 

Use [APA-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APA_style) citations. Example:
