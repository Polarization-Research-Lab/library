## Apply to Write for the Library

The Polarization Research Lab believes in the transparency and accessibility of research and data, and we hope for our Lab and website to be a source of usable information and a repository for research on these topics outside of a paywall. 

This project will create readable short summaries for publications on partisan animosity. Stored on our website, users will be able to read and learn about affective polarization, democratic norms, political violence, etc. in one place. We imagine users will be academics and graduate students writing literature reviews, undergraduates and even high school students first learning about these topics, and practitioners. As such, the summaries need to be written in a way that can speak to this diverse audience. 

As an author, we ask that you use our specified style and format (see `FORMAT` tab in sidebar) -- and commit to our tracking process. You will be paid $300 for each summary you satisfactorily complete. 

### How to apply

Find a set of five articles you would be willing to review (you can pick from [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RQAmTyc0V0hPYzaBMpP6AOLvPFZJ6OFrNDtiih7Of8k/edit#gid=0)).  We will pick one of your suggestions or work with you to identify an article from our list.

Submit an application to be a writer [at this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXt-JjOV2ZbuXFHbX7quSOdf-ofJsFu4FRfE1TeCkCb2E9fQ/viewform).

Note: 

- You can only work on one paper at a time.
- You can only work on papers that you have not written.  You should not have worked with any of the authors of a paper you are summarizing within the last five years.
