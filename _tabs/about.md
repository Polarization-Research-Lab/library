The Library of Partisan Animosity is a free resource for learning about partisan animosity for scholars, educators, students and practitioners. The library covers the top articles about polarization from 2000-present with a focus on the United States and future expansion to other countries.

One of the Labâ€™s top goals is to provide transparent and accessible research and information about topics of partisan animosity, including affective polarization, social trust and political violence. A breakdown in the dissemination of political science research to practitioners, media and citizens often occurs due to a lack of a centralized hub, inaccessible academic language and journal articles behind expensive paywalls. The Library of Partisan Animosity is the first-of-its-kind effort to bridge this gap by creating a free resource that is easy to navigate and clearly translates the key research and findings. 

Library summaries are written by academics with deep knowledge of American politics and research methodology while also using clear and accessible language.

The Library includes: 

- Summaries of the top academic journal articles from the past 20 years on partisan animosity 
- Links to the full journal article and citation information 
- Links to replication data 
- Information about the methodology and experiment(s) used in the paper
