## Article Summary

### Introduction ###
Concerns about increasing partisan animosity aren’t limited to just the U.S. Across several Western democracies, hostilities between members of opposing parties have risen. Several scholars have investigated features of these democracies that may lend themselves to more or less affective polarization, but one understudied component is the politicians themselves. That is, does it matter who holds office with regard to partisan animosity?

In their paper, Adams et al pull upon research on gender and politics to delve into this question. Previous scholars have noted women members of parliament (MPs) disproportionately display more favorable lawmaking and representative qualities compared to their male counterparts. Women MPs tend to be more consensual, less adversarial, and less negative in their leadership styles, which may reflect “gendered socialization processes or women’s strategic efforts to overcome marginalization within political institutions.” Citizens and journalists view women MPs consistent with many gender-trait stereotypes as being more compassionate and caring and voice preferences for institutions with greater female representation. 

As such, the authors of this paper contend citizens may display more positive affect toward rival parties with greater proportions of women MPs. Such a finding holds implications for descriptive representation, as parties may feel incentives to recruit more women lawmaking candidates for the parliamentary delegations as a means to reduce affective polarization and appeal to a broader base of voters.

### Analytical Approach ###
The authors combine data on women’s membership in parliamentary delegations in 20 Western democracies with survey data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) spanning 1996 to 2017. For each country, survey respondents complete 0-10 feeling thermometers of all parties active in the country. The authors average these thermometer ratings for each of the 1,842 directed party dyads in the data. For example, if the data included 3 parties, A, B, and C, there would be 6 party dyads (each party’s evaluation of the other two). 

For the main analysis, the authors regress the out-party affect measure for party j at time t on the proportion of women MPs in party j at time t-1. They control for ideological distance between parties and whether the parties in the dyad are coalition partners or opposition partners, which may influence baseline affective evaluations. The authors include year and country fixed effects, meaning the estimates are calculated within-country and within-election. The model can be visualized in the figure below:

If greater proportions of women in parliamentary delegations decreases affective polarization, we should expect to see a positive and significant coefficient for the main independent variable.

### Main Findings ###
Consistent with their hypothesis, the authors find greater levels of women’s descriptive representation in parties’ parliamentary delegations is associated with warmer feelings toward such parties. A one standard deviation increase in the proportion of women MPs (13% to 45%) increases feeling thermometer rates by 0.55 (one third of a standard deviation of the dependent variable, scaled 0-10). This finding persists with the inclusion of control variables for elite left-right ideological distance and whether the party dyad includes coalition or opposition partners (all of which have coefficient signs in the expected direction and are statistically significant). 

The authors conduct a number of robustness checks to corroborate their main result. They split their sample to male and female respondents only and also subset to later years in the data to focus on more modern campaigning environments. The results persist in both cases, as well as in different model specifications using alternative standard error clustering, individual-level units of analysis, and alternative country and year fixed effects.

Extending their findings, the authors consider whether there may be diminishing marginal returns in the affective bonus enjoyed by high-women MP proportion parties when the proportion exceeds 50% (ie, is beyond parity in the population). They add a squared term for women MP proportion to their model, and find it to be statistically significant and negative, implying that at the highest levels of women’s descriptive representation, parties begin to experience affective penalties from out-partisans. The authors also find the affective bonus of women MPs is greater in parties led by men.

### Implications ###
The study has implications for both affective polarization and descriptive representation of women in Western democracies. While many comparative studies have focused on more permanent features of electoral systems (such as proportionality), the composition of parliamentary delegations is somewhat more malleable and offers potential inroads against affective polarization.

Furthermore, the study implies benefits of women’s descriptive representation beyond increasing feelings of institutional trust. Having greater proportions of women MPs may help to bridge affective divides between parties, even when the ideological distance between them is large.

However, the study raises questions on how parties may leverage women’s descriptive representation to achieve their electoral ambitions. While an optimistic appraisal may hope parties genuinely try to ameliorate feelings of partisan animosity and increase parity through the recruitment of more women candidates, a more pessimistic view may be that parties artificially increase their gender parity as a means to justify more antidemocratic policies. 

### Questions left unanswered ###
While the authors determine there is a relationship between women’s descriptive representation and out-party affect, they do not directly test affective polarization as the dependent variable. So while we have a potential answer to the question of whether the proportion of women MPs is correlated with warmer feelings of opposition parties, we do not know if it reduces affective polarization, as the authors only utilize one of the component measures. Of course, this is likely to be supported by the data, and can be easily done with the replication materials.

## Limitations / Weaknesses

The authors insightfully correct a common but erroneous assumption among political scientists about the downstream effects of certain depolarization interventions on anti-democratic attitudes. By their own admission, they do not test all such interventions; just ones “perceived to be particularly promising ways to reduce affective polarization.” Herein may lie the basis of the subsequent null results; the interventions are the most effective for affective polarization, meaning they’re most aligned both psychologically and instrumentally with the underpinning of affective polarization, not anti-democratic attitudes. It is possible that less effective but more generalized interventions may have more success.  Take, for instance, recent work documenting what partisans have in mind when answering affective polarization questions. Druckman and Levendusky (POQ 2019) find respondents are more often answering the question with regard to party elites than to voters. Given the interventions in question often have more interpersonal framings, it seems possible the estimated reduction in affective polarization is due to a change in framing from elite evaluation to interpersonal sentiment. The question wordings for the anti-democracy and political violence items, however, seem less ambiguous and therefore more resistant to such changes in framing. Future work should consider how interventions change the ways in which respondents evaluate survey items.
