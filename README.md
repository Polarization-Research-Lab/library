# Pipeline

1. Hired writer submits summary to google form; auto saved to a google sheet
2. A script in `operations/library/` pulls from the google sheet and pushes to our RDS
3. Another script in `operations/library/` pulls from the RDS and generates local markdown files formatted in the way the Chirpy theme and Jekyll are expecting.
4. This repo is deployed as a github pages site, which is embedded in an iframe on our wordpress website.
